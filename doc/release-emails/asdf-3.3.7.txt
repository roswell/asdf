Today we release ASDF 3.3.7, "Robbie Burns Night 2024 (belated)," the seventh bugfix release for the 3.3 release series.  I had hoped that this would be the last bugfix release, but "the best laid schemes o' Mice an' Men Gang aft agley."

We urge implementations that are currently bundling previous versions of ASDF to upgrade to 3.3.7 at their earliest convenience.  This is particularly true for Allegro and SBCL.  A primary purpose of the 3.3.7 was to give compatibility with Allegro 11.0. There is also a fix for multi-threaded vs. single-threaded FASLs that should be very useful to SBCL users.

As maintainer, my primary role continues to be coordination and some limited quality control.  Many contributors and bug-reporters have made this possible and the Common Lisp community owes them a vote of thanks.  Their names are listed on the Changelog, appended below. The Changelog is in Debian format, for historical reasons: we used to release a Debian package, but have lost that capability (if you would like to volunteer to do this, please contact me directly or on the ASDF-devel mailing list).

Hope springs eternal that the next release will be 3.4, that will introduce new functionality but, as its numbering suggests, will be backward compatible.

Best,
Robert
